- Availability
- Confidentiality
- Data protection & Integrity
- Authentication & Authorization
- Accountability
- Privacy and Compliance (GDPR)
## NIST Risk Management Framework usage
Other than those, in the design phase a threat analysis has been conducted, leading to the identification of mitigations through the use of the NIST Risk Management Framework SP 800-53 Rev. 5.1 which shows security control to follow to reach desired cybersecurity posture. The publication NIST SP 800-53B, introduces the Control Baselines, to follow after choosing the cybersecurity posture desired.
This app reached the medium-impact Control Baseline in the main categories:
- Access Control
- Identification and Authentication
- Audit and Accountability
